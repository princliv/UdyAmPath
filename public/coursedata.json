              "content": "Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that code written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This principle is often referred to as 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' (WORA). Java has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, widely used for web development, mobile applications, enterprise software, and even game development.\n\n    Java was originally developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems. It was initially called 'Oak' after an oak tree outside Goslingâ€™s office. However, due to trademark issues, the name was later changed to 'Java,' inspired by Java coffee. The language was officially released in 1995, and it quickly gained popularity due to its robust features and cross-platform compatibility.\n\n    Java programs are written using a specific syntax. Below is a simple Java program:\n    ```java\n    public class HelloWorld {\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    This program prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.\n\n    Java remains a powerful and versatile language with applications across multiple domains. Learning Java opens doors to numerous career opportunities in software development, web development, and mobile app development."
